# Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project dedicated to the detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning techniques. The objective is to build an efficient and reliable system for early detection and diagnosis of ASD, leveraging data analysis and machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the dataset for training and testing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection**: Methods to select the most important features to improve model accuracy and performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes (NB)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of data distribution and model performance using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - seaborn

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
